#(10 0 0 -10 46 79.4425) On January 29, 2007, Adobe 
#(10 0 0 -10 46 91.7975) Systems Incorporated announced 
#(10 0 0 -10 46 104.153) it''s intention to release the 
#(10 0 0 -10 46 116.507) full Portable Document Format 
#(10 0 0 -10 46 128.862) (PDF) 1.7 specification to the 
#(10 0 0 -10 46 141.217) American National Standard 
#(10 0 0 -10 46 153.572) Institute (ANSI) and the 
#(10 0 0 -10 46 165.927) Enterprise Content Management 
#(10 0 0 -10 46 178.282) Association (AIIM), for the 
#(10 0 0 -10 46 190.637) purpose of publication by the 
#(10 0 0 -10 46 202.992) International Organization for 
#(10 0 0 -10 46 215.347) Standardization (ISO).
#(10 0 0 -10 226.0 79.4425) PDF has become a de facto 
#(10 0 0 -10 226.0 91.7975) global standard for more secure 
#(10 0 0 -10 226.0 104.153) and dependable information 
#(10 0 0 -10 226.0 116.507) exchange since Adobe published 
#(10 0 0 -10 226.0 128.862) the complete PDF specification 
#(10 0 0 -10 226.0 141.217) in 1993. Both government and 
#(10 0 0 -10 226.0 153.572) private industry have come to 
#(10 0 0 -10 226.0 165.927) rely on PDF for the volumes of 
#(10 0 0 -10 226.0 178.282) electronic records that need to 
#(10 0 0 -10 226.0 190.637) be more securely and reliably 
#(10 0 0 -10 226.0 202.992) shared, managed, and in some 
#(10 0 0 -10 226.0 215.347) cases preserved for 
#(10 0 0 -10 226.0 227.702) generations. Since 1995 Adobe 
#(10 0 0 -10 226.0 240.057) has participated in various 
#(10 0 0 -10 226.0 252.412) working groups that develop 
#(10 0 0 -10 226.0 264.767) technical specifications for 
#(10 0 0 -10 226.0 277.122) publication by ISO and worked 
#(10 0 0 -10 226.0 289.477) within the ISO process to 
#(10 0 0 -10 226.0 301.832) deliver specialized subsets of 
#(10 0 0 -10 226.0 314.187) PDF as standards for specific 
#(10 0 0 -10 226.0 326.542) industries and functions.

#(10 0 0 -10 226.0 363.608) are ISO standards, and PDF for 
#(10 0 0 -10 226.0 375.963) Engineering (PDF/E) and PDF 
#(10 0 0 -10 226.0 388.318) for Universal Access (PDF/UA) 
#(10 0 0 -10 226.0 400.673) are proposed standards. 
#(10 0 0 -10 226.0 413.028) Additionally, PDF for 
#(10 0 0 -10 226.0 425.383) Healthcare (PDF/H) is an AIIM 
#(10 0 0 -10 226.0 437.738) proposed Best Practice Guide.
